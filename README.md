LED Morse Signal - Assembly Language Project

Project Overview:

LED Morse Signal is a low-level assembly language project that controls an LED display to show both numbers and letters, with the unique feature of converting letters to Morse code and blinking them on the LED. The program is designed to efficiently manage binary data and produce precise timing signals required for Morse code display.

Key Features:

	•	LED Number Display: Converts numbers into binary format and displays them using an LED interface.
	•	Morse Code Conversion: Converts letters to Morse code, blinking the signals on the LED.
	•	Binary Data Handling: Optimized to handle binary conversions for both numbers and letters.
	•	Precise Timing Control: Ensures the correct timing intervals for the Morse code dots, dashes, and spaces.
	•	Alternating Display: Alternates between displaying numbers and letters in Morse code based on user input or predefined settings.

Technologies Used:

	•	Assembly Language: Low-level programming for direct control of the hardware (LED and timing mechanisms).
	•	Microcontroller Platform: Developed for use on specific microcontroller hardware.
	•	Custom Timing Logic: Ensures accurate transmission of Morse code symbols.
